    <p class="vidcaption">This is me playing drums in my band! We're called Senza and we've been together for over a decade. We recently completed a tour from Eugene, OR to Chicago, IL and back, playing 15 shows spread out across 16 days. I'm really proud of the work I've done with Senza.</p>

        This is my first ever video I uploaded to youtube, which was almost 18 years ago now! It is a video of the time my family and I were on television because my dad correctly answered a question online for a gameshow special where celebrities played classic gameshows. It was like had won everything from going on The Price is Right without having to actually go on The Price is Right. Funny bit of trivia about this video is that they showed up at our house and filmed us for 4 hours, telling us things like "Okay, this time when you exit the house, be more excited and jump up and down a bunch!" After they finished filming, they loaded all of the prizes back into the truck and drove away. It wasn't until months later that we received all of the prizes, all delivered individually.
